This repo provides technical resources for faculty, students, and Microsoft developer advocates for use in computer science learning. The modules cover common cross-platform scenarios including mobile app dev, web dev, internet of things, data science, machine learning, and devops. We offer hands-on labs that can be used in the classroom or as workshop content, as well as other educator content including tech talks, coding challenges, and event-in-a-box workshops.

Students can get free Azure credits to explore these resources in the classroom or on their own here:
* [Azure For Students ($100 in Azure - no credit card required)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)
* [Azure For Students Starter (use free Azure products with no credit card)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students-starter-faq/)
* [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
