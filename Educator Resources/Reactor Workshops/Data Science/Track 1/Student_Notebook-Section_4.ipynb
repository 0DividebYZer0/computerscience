The pandas library in Python does a lot to make working with data--and importing, cleaning, and organizing it--so much easier that it is hard to imagine doing data science in Python without it.\n",

The library has since taken off as an open-source software project that has become a mature and integral part of the data-science ecosystem. (In fact, some examples in this section are drawn from McKinney's book, *Python for Data Analysis*.)\n",

Ironically, while panel data is a usable data structure in pandas, it is not generally used today and we will not examine it in this course. Instead, we will focus on the two most widely used data structures in pandas: `Series` and `DataFrames`."
