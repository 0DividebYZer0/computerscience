# Adafruit Feather Azure IOT Suite

The aim of this mini project is for the Adafruit Feather to communicate with to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. Adafruit Feather should be able to send telemetry messages and also respond to commands sent to it by the IoT hub. The Adafruit Feather component used in this project is from the Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kits
