# Adafruit_IoTSuite_Integration
The aim of this mini project is for the Adafruit Feather to communicate with to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. Adafruit Feather should be able to send telemetry messages and also respond to commands sent to it by the IoT hub. The Adafruit Feather component used in this project is from the Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kits 

# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi (Arduino-compatible)

This page contains technical information to help you get familiar with Azure IoT using the Azure IoT Starter Kit - Feather M0 WiFi (Arduino-compatible). You will find two tutorials that will walk you through different scenarios: the first tutorial will show you how to connect your Azure IoT Starter kit to our Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution from Azure IoT Suite. In the second tutorial, you will leverage Azure IoT services to create your own IoT architecture.

You can choose to start with whichever tutorial you want to. If you've never worked with Azure IoT services before, we encourage you to start with the Remote Monitoring solution tutorial, because all of the Azure services will be provisioned for you in a built-in preconfigured solution. Then you can explore how each of the services work by going through the second tutorial.

 We hope you enjoy the process. Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.

# Running a Simple Remote Monitoring Solution on Feather M0 WiFi (Arduino-compatible)


This tutorial describes the process of taking your Feather M0 WiFi kit, and using it to develop a temperature, humidity and pressure reader that can communicate with the cloud using the  Microsoft Azure IoT SDK. 


###Required Software

- Arduino IDE, version 1.6.8. from www.arduino.cc (Earlier versions will not work with the AzureIoT library)
- Sensor interface library from Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library/archive/master.zip

###Required Hardware

- Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi kit
  - A microB USB cable
  - A desktop or laptop computer which can run **Arduino IDE 1.6.8**
