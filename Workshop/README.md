            The Azure Workshop is a series of hands-on coding labs to help computer science faculty and student quickly learn how to deploy solutions to the Azure cloud across common scenarios like Web Dev, App Dev, IoT, and Data Science with Machine Learning using cross-platform technologies. Most labs can be completed with Windows, Mac or Linux and take between 60-90 minutes to complete. Your feedback is welcome in improving these labs.
