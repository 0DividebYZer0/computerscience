# Azure Workshop

The Azure Workshop is a collection of hands-on coding labs designed to help Computer Science faculty and students learn how to deploy solutions to the Azure cloud involving common scenarios such as Web development, AI and machine learning, data science, and IoT using cross-platform technologies. Most labs are compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux and take 60 to 90 minutes to complete.

The labs fall into six general categories:

- AI and Machine Learning
- Azure Services
- Big Data and Analytics
- Deep Learning
- Internet-of-Things
- Web Development

Examples include [building a machine-learning model that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](AI%20and%20Machine%20Learning/Azure%20Machine%20Learning), deploying an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) that [evaluates images uploaded to blob storage for adult content](), and [building a BlockChain network on Azure](). Feel free to explore the folders and subfolders in this repo to discover all sorts of interesting exercises and use them to hone your Azure knowledge and development skills.
