# Workshop VM

Click the button below to open the Azure Portal and create a virtual machine (VM) provisioned with Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio Code, and other tools needed to work the hands-on labs. **You must have an active Azure subscription in order to create the VM**. Be sure to stop the VM when you're finished using it to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
